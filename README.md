# Deprecated

This project is deprecated and replaced by [equinix-sdk-go](https://github.com/equinix/equinix-sdk-go).

Equinix made a decision to keep SDKs consistent by using the Open-API-Generator project instead of 
the Swagger Codegen project that this Go SDK is built with. The equinix-sdk-go project also houses
multiple Equinix products instead of just Fabric so it's easier to discover and use each client that
published.

Currently this SDK is up to date with Fabric 4.14 API Spec. The final update will be to sync this SDK
with the Fabric 4.15 API Spec in August 2024. After that please move to equinix-sdk-go for your Go SDK
needs with Equinix.
